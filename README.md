# scraper-ssp-sp
Scraper for the SSP-SP site.

This project was created to help download a xls file with data from the SSP-SP site in an easy and clean way.
Since the SSP-SP site is a government site, the idea was to download a xls file instead of extract html tables from all the pages
so we wouldn't hit the server too hard.
